# GifTastic

This is a gif generating page created with a fighting game character theme.  Images are pulled via AJAX from the GIPHY API(see below for link).  To gather images, simply click on one of the buttons located towards the top of the page.  Or, if you have a favorite fighter, enter the character's name in the "Choose Your Fighter" text bar and press on the select button.  You will see a new button has been generated for the character; click on this button to generate images.  

You may view each image's animation by clicking on it.  Click on it again to make the animation stop.  Also, mind the rating above each image.  If an image is rated R, it may potentially be gruesome.  

## Getting Started

This project can be found in my github portfolio here: https://github.com/JoeLearns2Code/GifTastic

The live page can be found here: https://joelearns2code.github.io/GifTastic

Additionally, this page can be accessed from my portfolio page here: https://joelearns2code.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/portfolio.html

### Prerequisites

You will need access to a common web browser to view the live page.  The data can also be pulled directly from GitHub via GitBash on PC or via Terminal on Mac.


### Installing

When you have accessed the repository page on GitHub, you may simply download a Zip file and extract it to a directory of your choosing.  Alternatively, you may download the data directly to your device via GitBash if you have an SSH key.  More on adding an SSH key can be found here: https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

To download via GitBash, once you have a working SSH key with GitHub, create a folder you wish to download data into.  Next, click on the green 'Download or Clone' button on the GitHub respoitory page.  Make sure you have SSH key selected(and not HTTPS), and click on the clipboard icon.  This copies the address to your clipboard.

Next, navigate to the folder you wish to download the data into via GitBash or Terminal, and then simply type "git clone" followed by the link you copied onto your clipboard(paste via ctrl/cmd+v).  Press the enter key, and GitBash will pull the entire repository into your folder.


## Testing
